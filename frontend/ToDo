I do not like the current frontend but this is a starting version
so here are the Todos
1. verify all code 
2. adjust the height of the Tree Canvas 
3. adjust colours of buttons and tree boxes
4. make boxes separated in each subtree
5. fix arrows 
6. add more info (block pointer, record, etc)
7. add arrows connecting leef subtrees 
8. maybe add a [..blocks..] under the tree for the actual memory
9. adjust tree boxes colours
10. what is the hashtag at the top of the box ?
11. Implement and Integrate Backend
12. add command for reflecting changes in the code without having to rerun npm start
